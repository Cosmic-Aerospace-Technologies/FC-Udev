## üß© Code Structure  

### Key Sections  
- **Setup**: Initializes the sensors, peripherals, and SD card module.  
- **Loop**: Contains the main program logic for telemetry logging, launch detection, and recovery system deployment.  
- **Functions**:  
  - `printTelemetry()`: Logs and prints sensor data.  
  - `flight()`: Handles the flight phase, including event-based logic.  
  - `deploy()`: Executes recovery system deployment.  
  - `startup()`: Provides a startup sequence for user feedback.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use  

1. **Data Logging**:  
   - Enable or disable logging by setting the `dataLogging` variable in the code.  
2. **Customizing Deployment**:  
   - Adjust the apogee delay using the `delayTime` variable.  
3. **Telemetry**:  
   - View real-time data via the serial monitor or access the recorded telemetry in the `data.txt` file on the SD card.
